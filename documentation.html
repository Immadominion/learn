<p>Submission for the Solana Superteam UK Bounty: Build a Product Using The Grid API.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Grid is a startup that aggregates data from various Solana ecosystem products, teams, and companies, making it easier for developers to access this information. Potential applications integrating with The Grid include wallets, DEXs, data platforms, ecosystem pages, token lists, block explorers, retail platforms, exchanges, and compliance tools.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Accessing comprehensive and organized data from the Solana ecosystem can be challenging for developers. This bounty aims to encourage the development of innovative products that leverage The Grid API to solve real-world problems and enhance the Solana ecosystem.</p>
<p>For moderators, it might be hard to keep track of XPs per event or distribute USDC after a Kahoot session in an ecosystem call.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>We developed a quiz app where users can choose quiz topics that query The Grid API, using Gemini to generate the questions. This product showcases innovation, completeness, and relevance to current market needs.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-repo/quiz-app.git
cd quiz-app
flutter pub get
flutter run
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Open the app, select a quiz topic, and start answering questions. The app will fetch questions from The Grid API and present them in a user-friendly format.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fetches real-time quiz questions from The Grid API.</li>
    <li>Generates questions using Gemini.</li>
    <li>Interactive UI with progress tracking.</li>
    <li>Leaderboard to track top scorers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>API Integration</h2>
<p>The app integrates with The Grid API to fetch quiz questions and other relevant data. For more information on The Grid API, visit <a href="https://thegrid.explorer">The Grid Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Market Fit Analysis</h2>
<p>This quiz app addresses the need for educational and interactive content within the Solana ecosystem. By leveraging The Grid API, we provide users with up-to-date information and an engaging way to learn about Solana-related topics.</p>
